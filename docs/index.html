        <h1>Tracklist Builder Documentation ðŸ“„</h1>

        <h3>Motivation ðŸ¦‰</h3>
        <p>The purpose of this application is to help djs to create there own tracklists. By emulating the music selection of popular tracklists, based on the Spotify track (ML-based) descriptors, a dj can create a similar tracklist that matches the same variations in "energy" (or in general, in spotify descriptors). In this way, the new generated tracklist is similar in "energy", "feeling", "music selection", etc; but with different songs, that the dj can choose personally, therefore creating a personalized end result.</p>
